    <p>Track Bus Movement and Location</p>

    <p>Currently in Rwanda, specifically in Kigali, commuters spend on average 45 mins at the bus stations or in queues
        waiting
        for buses to come and moreover, This number normally goes high in peak hours (7:00 - 8:00, 18:00 - 20:00).

        Commuters would love a solution to address this problem; they would like to have a way to check the location of
        buses on
        their respective routes and plan accordingly so they donâ€™t have to wait for it.

        This is the problem Phantom is here to solve: Create an application that allows simulating bus movements and
        enabling
        passengers to track their locations & movements
